Introduction
---
This is an attempt at writing a PID system from scratch in Node.js

All my knowledge about and experience with PIDs comes from From the Depths and Wikipedia, and I'm not a good programmer.
I might attempt this in C one day. Or rust perhaps.

How to run
---------

1. Install node.js
Install [node.js-t](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Compile and run
```bash
npx tsc --outDir ./build main.ts && node ./build/main.js
```

(instructions may be incomplete)

Why
---
JS is the future. I eagerly await the day when factories will be programmed with nothing else but this 10 day miracle of a language. From the smallest temperature or humidity sensor to the million dollar PLCs, and even the websites that the factory clients interface with to make their order. (using JS for web development? Who does that, right?) 

JS will be the one grand unifying programming language. Until that day I will rest easy knowing I did my part. 

And when the time comes I too shall laugh in the face of god, for we'll have forsaken him.
